## Sourcetree

is a wrapper for GIT/other version control software that looks like a finder window and not like a command line.

## MacDown

is a lovely *Mac*-friendly **Markdown** editor! It's how I made this .md document! It's colorful and cute!

## BBedit

is my personal favourite way to write Python. I have a Terminal window next door with 2+ tabs. One is used for the `python <name_of_script.py>` commands. The other I keep `iPython` open on so I can test little chunks of code. When I find something that works, I add it to a growing `BBEdit` document so that if I want to do it again, I can re-run that script. I find that things get less crazy this way rather than if I'm using jupyter notebooks.

## `conda`

Ever had to mess around with python pathing? It's not fun and I don't like it. If you just make `conda` your python distribution then you will be a lot less likely to end up tying yourself in a big pathing mess :(

## NASA ADS

FIND ANY ASTRONOMY PAPER! VERY HIGH COMPLETENESS!

I have an alias set up on chrome so I can just go "ADS \tab" and then use the default chrome search bar to search on ADS. It saves, like, two website loads a day. 

## lean library

Do you like paywalls? Me neither! This chrome extension lets you get around paywalls if you sign up with a student email!

## MathPix

Quickly convert mathematics screenshots into Latex code!!

## Cyberduck

This one's for anyone who works with a supercomputer. You can see what you're doing. You can open files on the supercomputer with your editor-of-choice and save the results directly back to the computer they came from. Downloading and uploading files is as easy as clicking and dragging. I really enjoy it.
